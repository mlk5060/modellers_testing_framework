;;; ABOUT THIS SOFTWARE
;;;
;;; The functions in this file support use of a testing framework for 
;;; scientific theories.  Tests are separated into three classes, as 
;;; described in [1]:
;;; 1. Unit tests - for implementational details
;;; 2. Process tests - for the main processes within the theory
;;; 3. Canonical results - for the experimental results achieved by the
;;;                        theory
;;; [1] P.C.R. Lane and F. Gobet, Developing reproducible and comprehensible
;;;     computational models, Artificial Intelligence, 144:251--63, 2003.

;;; INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE 
;;; 
;;; Individual tests are written in one of the following forms:
;;; (test THING-TO-CHECK [MESSAGE])
;;;       where: THING-TO-CHECK is a test, returning a boolean value
;;;                             test should return T if the test passed 
;;;              MESSAGE is optional, and is given if the test is NIL
;;; (assert-= EXPECTED ACTUAL [MESSAGE])
;;; (assert-eq EXPECTED ACTUAL [MESSAGE])
;;; (assert-equalp EXPECTED ACTUAL [MESSAGE])
;;; (assert-string= EXPECTED ACTUAL [MESSAGE])
;;;       where: EXPECTED is the predicted value
;;;              ACTUAL is the computed value
;;;              EXPECTED and ACTUAL are compared using respective function
;;;              MESSAGE is optional, and given if the comparison fails
;;; (assert-true THING-TO-CHECK [MESSAGE]) is the same as (test THING-TO-CHECK MESSAGE)
;;; (assert-false THING-TO-CHECK [MESSAGE]) is the same as (test (not THING-TO-CHECK) MESSAGE)
;;; (assert-null THING-TO-CHECK [MESSAGE]) is the same as (test (null THING-TO-CHECK) MESSAGE)
;;;
;;; To create a group of tests, use either of: 
;;; def-unit-tests
;;; def-process-tests
;;; def-canonical-result-tests
;;; All three do the same job, which is to define a function containing one or 
;;; more calls to (test .. ..)
;;; The framework stores the functions in one of the three categories of tests.
;;;
;;; Tests can be run using either of:
;;; (run-unit-tests)             evaluates every function defined using def-unit-tests
;;; (run-process-tests)          evaluates every function defined using def-process-tests
;;; (run-canonical-result-tests) evaluates every function defined using def-canonical-result-tests
;;; (run-all-tests)              evaluates all three of the above, running all tests
