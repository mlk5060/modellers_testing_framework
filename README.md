Modellers Testing Framework
===========================

This is a simple testing framework to support computational modellers in
separating out the scientific value of different aspects of their code.  The
code is assumed to provide an architecture (or framework), supporting the
development of different models (or simulations).  

Tests are divided into three groups:

* Unit tests: for low-level, implementational details of the architecture.
* Process tests: for functional aspects, usually linked to terms used within the implemented scientific theory.
* Canonical result tests: for the implemented models based on the architecture.
